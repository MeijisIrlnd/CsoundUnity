      <p>CsoundUnity is a fully integrated audio middleware for the Unity(3D) game engine based in C#. It extends Unity's audio API by creating Csound-based AudioSource objects that can interact and exist alongside regular AudioSource objects. With CsoundUnity, games developers have at their fingertips one of the most powerful synthesis systems in existence.</p>

      <h3>Version 2 released</h3>
      Version 2.0 is now ready for download. This release brings about a lot of changes from the previous package. Much of the utility functions that shipped with the previous versions have been removed in a move towards better integration with Unity's own audio API. Here's a run-down of the changes:
      <ul>
        <li> Each CsoundUnity component now requires an AudioSource object. Ergo, each CsoundUnity component is embedded into an AudioSource.
        <li> Csound no longers outputs audio, this is all left to Unity. 
        <li> Previous versions only allowed for a single Csound file, this version can place a Csound file on as many GameObjects as there are in a scene. Each file is read using an unique instance of Csound, and each file can run as many Csound instruments as you like. 
        <li> Because each CsoundUnity component is wrapped in an AudioSource, it's now possible to use Unity's own 3D Audio Settings to add movement and space to your Csound instruments. 
        <li> Users can now audition their Csound instruments inside the Unity Editor. Instruments can be controlled using sliders, checkboxes and toggles without ever having to write a line of C#. 
      </ul>
